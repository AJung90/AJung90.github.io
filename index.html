	<h1>The Golden Age of Tennis</h1>
		<p>In today's game of tennis, we as an audience have been blessed with an opportunity to see three of the greatest players to ever step on the court. While there have been great tennis players in the past, <em>never</em> have we seen three players so dominant playing during the same era and fighting for the same trophies.</p>

		<p>After browsing through the page source of the page linked above, I found it quite difficult to read. Much of the code in the page I'm assuming pertains to styling with CSS. Other than that, I saw that there were a lot of link tags, probably to other pages within the folder that this page was contained in. I saw that for the images used within the page there were "sizes" associated with them, which I think formats the image to show up to be a specific dimension on the page. </p>
